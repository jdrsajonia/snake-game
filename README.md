## Game Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher (menu.py use match cases)
- [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library (included in `requirements.txt`)



###  Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Windows users:** If your terminal doesn't support ANSI escape codes, install `colorama` and initialize it in `main.py`:  
  ```bash
  pip install colorama
- If you're running a Linux system, make sure to have an X-server started to detect the Keyboard and avoid unexpected errors (feature done automatically when you start GUI session)

## üíª How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies indicated in requirements.txt with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Or manually:

    
    pip install pynput

### 2. Execute snaky.py file to initialize the game:

    python snaky.py


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Skip the menu
If you wanna bypass the menu feature and just play, execute snake_game.py file with:

    python -m objects.snake_game.py

   
Maybe i could do a .bat or .sh run executable to do this automatically
