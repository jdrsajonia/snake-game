## Game Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- 'pynput' library (listed in 'requirements.txt')


### Note:

- If you PC doesnÂ´t support ANSI colors you will need to  install and init 'colorama' module at the main.py. Do it with >> **pip install colorama**
- If you're running a Linux system, make sure to have an X-server started to detect the Keyboard (feature done automatically when you start GUI session)



### 1. Install dependencies indicated in requirements.txt with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

or you can do manually

    
    pip install pynput

### 2. Execute main.py file to initialize the game:

    python main.py


If you wanna bypass the menu feature and just play, go to /objects and execute snake_game.py file with:

    python snake_game.py

   
Maybe i could do a .bat or .sh run executable to do this automatically
