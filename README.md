This README is ugly right now. I promise you it will be better.

Important instructions to follow!

1.) Install dependencies indicated in requirements.txt with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

or you can do

    
    pip install pynput

2.) execute controller.py file to initialize the game:

    python controller.py


If you dont want to contaminate your system with dependencies (if you are Windows user) run follow commands below:

    python -m venv env
    env/Scripts/activate
    pip install pynput
    python controller.py
Maybe i could do a .bat or .sh run executable to do this automatically

DEFAULT CONTROLS!: 

    W: up
    A: left
    S: down
    D: right

Enjoy it!
